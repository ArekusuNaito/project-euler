You can add a border to your CSS elements.

To add a border you will use the `border-width` property.

```css
border-width: 5px;
```

But in order to see it you have to add a style:

```css
border-width: 5px;
border-style: solid;
```

With the style `solid` you will be a `solid border-line` around your element.
