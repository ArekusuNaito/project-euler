Every programming language makes use of something called `Variables`.

`Variables` are pretty much named like that because they _vary_ -- they change.
As a heads up, there's also a concept called `Constants`, which they are "the opposite", as these don't change.

Here is an example, we are going to create a `variable` named `myName`.

```js
let myName = "Alex";
```

Just as simple as that, we created in our computer's memory a variable named `myName`. And we also did another thing, we assigned a value to this variable, the value we assigned was: `Alex`.

Notice that `Alex` is surrounded by the quotes. *This means our variable will be of a specific type. This variable will work with "letters", as how programming names then, strings*

```js
let myName = "Alex"; //Words, or formally, strings.
let myAge = 15; //Numbers, we can use decimals or integers.
let amICool = true; //Boolean values, pretty much, yes and no. We use true and false.

```

One thing that we will slowly learn and get used to, is that, by being a language, a language has a set of rules and structure. To go right to the point, this is pretty much what we call `syntax`.

To declare a varible, we will first use a word called `let`. To its right, we are going to use a word of our liking, in this case I used `myName`, notice that there there should be no spaces here, if you use a space you are not fulfilling the sintax. After the `variableName` we are going to use a `=` symbol. This is called the `assigment operator`, we are going to put the value to the right of the `=` symbol, inside of our variable. Finally we will place the value of that variable there. I will list the code once again:

```js
let myName = "Alex";
// let <VariableName without spaces> = < a value goes here>
```

If we are interested on how this kind of syntax came to be, the origin is mostly an inspiration from Algebra. So, it would be a wise idea to study Algebra if we want to understand these things better, as programming needs math to operate it.
