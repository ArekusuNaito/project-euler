In this lesson we learn about how we can name the lines/tracks of the grid and use those names/aliases to set as property.


The tracks can have names and you even use it for the `grid-area` property as well.

The syntax to name them goes inside the `templates` properties.

For example:

- `grid-template-columns: [fullColumn-start menu-start]1fr[menu-end content-start] 5fr [content-end fullColumn-end];`
