// Hey there, Welcome!
// I will be your guide through the vast world of programming.
// First I wanna show you a simpler language, like Javascript.
// We will be using NodeJS, so we can run this on a terminal.


//As programmers we have to use a language to interface with our computer and give it commands.
//These commands will let the computer how to do things.
//Our first and simple example will be to output a message to the terminal.
//The most common message when learning something in programming is the "Hello World" Program.
//This is how you would do it.

console.log("Hello World!");

//That's it. As simple as that you are now a programmer. Even if this is the simplest of programs.
//Now go ahead and run this program.
//Open up a terminal and write: node 1-printMessage.ts
//See what it does
