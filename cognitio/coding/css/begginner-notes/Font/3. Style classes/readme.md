Classes are re-usable ways to style components.
Most of the time you will make use of these, you won't be making high modifications to "vanilla" tags, but you will making your own custom classes to add the required styling.

The syntax is followed by a dot/period like this:

```html
<p class="redText">This text should be red!</p>
```

```css
.redText
{
    color: red;
}
```

These 2 blocks of code will reflect the desired changes.  We are "classifying" that particular "p" tag to be red with a name we also made up, in this case, we decided to call this class "redText".
