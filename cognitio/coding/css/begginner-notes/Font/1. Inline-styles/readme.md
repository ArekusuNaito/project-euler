You can see here that we can add styles to our HTML components by adding an attribute called: `style`

It would look like this

```html
<p style="color: red">This is a red paragraph!</p>
```

You can use any css-property here, however the dis-advantage is that your HTML code will become difficult to read, as you will in-line making those graphical changes.

I used a lot of resources from this website.
